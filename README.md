# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

     A hands-on project demonstrating the power of the MERN stack by creating a functional e-commerce platform.

## E-Commerce Application using MERN Stack

Welcome to the E-Commerce Application project! ðŸš€ This project involves building a full-fledged e-commerce platform from scratch using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and documentation for the application.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features of the Application

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and retrieve product details.
- **Order Handling**: Seamlessly manage customer orders.
- **REST API Integration**: Well-structured endpoints for interaction.
- **Database Schema Design**: Efficient schema structure in MongoDB.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access for secure transactions.

### Milestone 13: Update Functionality

This milestone focuses on implementing the update functionality for product data.  Key achievements include:

    *   Developed a backend endpoint to receive updated product information and persist changes to the MongoDB database.
    *   Implemented frontend functionality to pre-populate a product edit form with existing data when the "Edit" button is clicked.
    *   Enabled users to modify the pre-filled data and save the updates, triggering the backend update process.

This milestone demonstrates a solid understanding of update operations in a full-stack context, covering both backend data persistence and user-friendly frontend form handling.

- Configured the endpoint to receive product, user, and address details.
- Retrieved the user's `_id` from the database using the user's email.
- Created individual order documents for each product in the cart, all associated with the same delivery address.
- Stored the order details in the MongoDB `order` collection using the previously defined Mongoose schema.



### Milestone 26

- Implemented a backend endpoint to retrieve all orders for a specific user.
- Configured the endpoint to receive the user's email.
- Retrieved the user's `_id` from the database using the provided email.
- Queried the `order` collection in MongoDB to fetch all orders associated with the user's `_id`.

### Milestone 27

- Created a "My Orders" page in the frontend.
- Implemented a GET request to the `/my-orders` backend endpoint, passing the user's email.
- Displayed all retrieved user orders on the "My Orders" page.
- Added a link to the "My Orders" page in the navigation bar for easy access.



### Milestone 28

- Added a "Cancel Order" button to each order displayed on the "My Orders" page.
- Implemented conditional rendering to hide the "Cancel Order" button for already canceled orders.
- Created a backend endpoint to handle order cancellation, receiving the order ID.

### Milestone 29

- Created a PayPal developer account and accessed the sandbox environment.
- Retrieved and saved the sandbox account's UserID and Client ID.
- Added payment options (COD and online payment) to the order confirmation page using radio buttons.

- Developed the `setEmail` action creator in `userActions.js` to update the global email state.
- Wrapped the `App` component in `index.js` with the `Provider` component, passing the configured Redux store as a prop.



### Milestone 32

- Utilized Redux for global state management and accessed the state across all pages.
- Implemented the `dispatch` method in the Login page to store the user's email in the global Redux state.
- Accessed the stored email in all other pages using the `useSelector` hook to retrieve the email from the Redux store.



### Milestone 33

- Learned how to create JWT tokens and store them in cookies.
- Installed the `jsonwebtoken` npm package.
- Implemented the `sign` method to create JWT tokens, including user email and ID in the payload.
- Set the `maxAge` option to define the token's expiration time.
- Added the generated JWT token to the HTTP response as a cookie, enabling the browser to store it.



### Milestone 34

- Learned how to extract JWT tokens from browser cookies and send them to the server.
- Implemented client-side logic to retrieve the JWT token from cookies and include it in requests to the server.
- Developed a backend middleware function to validate received JWT tokens.
- Ensured that this validation middleware is applied to all protected routes, preventing unauthorized access to pages without a valid login.


**Key Objectives:**

* Implement a backend endpoint that retrieves products from MongoDB, filtering by the user's email address.
